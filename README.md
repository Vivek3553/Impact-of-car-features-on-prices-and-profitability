# Impact-of-car-features-on-prices-and-profitability
Overview
The automotive industry is changing rapidly with a focus on fuel efficiency, sustainability, and new technology. To stay competitive and profitable, car manufacturers need data-driven decisions for pricing and product development. This project addresses how to optimize pricing and product features to maximize profit while meeting consumer demand.

Problem Statement
The client wants to:

Maximize profitability
Meet consumer demand
Adapt to trends like electric and hybrid vehicles
We'll analyze the relationship between car features (e.g., fuel type, body style, transmission) and pricing to find the most popular and profitable features.

Approach
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Load and clean the dataset
Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze key features and patterns in the data
Understand how pricing relates to different car features
3. Regression Analysis
Use regression models to predict car prices based on features
Identify the most profitable features for pricing strategies
4. Market Segmentation
Segment the market by consumer preferences and car features
Recommend profitable market segments for product development
5. Feature Importance Analysis
Use models like Random Forest to find key features that impact pricing and demand
Focus on features that should be prioritized in future car models
6. Pricing Strategy
Develop a pricing strategy based on consumer demand and profitability
Recommend price adjustments to stay competitive
Expected Outcomes
By the end of the project, the manufacturer will:

Understand the relationship between features, pricing, and demand
Have insights on the most popular and profitable car features
Receive recommendations on pricing and future product development
Be better prepared to adapt to trends like electric and hybrid vehicles
Tools & Techniques
Python for data analysis
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualizations
Scikit-learn for regression and feature analysis
Clustering for market segmentation
Jupyter Notebooks for running analysis
Dataset
The dataset includes:

Car Features: Fuel type, transmission, engine size, body style
Pricing: Car prices across different markets
Market Categories: Segment types (compact, luxury, SUV, etc.)
Conclusion
This project will help car manufacturers create a data-driven strategy for pricing and product development. By understanding which features drive consumer demand and profitability, the manufacturer can stay competitive and adapt to new industry trends.
